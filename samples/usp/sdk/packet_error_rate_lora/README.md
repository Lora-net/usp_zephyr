# Packet Error Rate (LoRa) Example

This application performs **Packet Error Rate (PER) testing** between two devices to evaluate radio link quality and reliability using LoRa modulation. One device acts as a transmitter sending numbered packets, while the other acts as a receiver counting successful receptions and calculating error rates in real-time.

## Key Features

- **Dual Role Operation**: Configurable as either transmitter or receiver at compile time
- **Structured Payload**: Packets contain header ("PER"), separator, and incremental counter
- **Real-time Statistics**: Tracks exchange count, failure count, and calculates PER during test
- **Series-based Testing**: Runs batches of 100 exchanges with inter-series delays
- **Payload Validation**: Verifies header integrity and counter sequence
- **Missing Packet Detection**: Automatically detects and counts skipped packets
- **LED Feedback**: Visual indication of TX/RX activity

### Operation Modes

- **Transmitter Mode**: Sends numbered packets sequentially with configurable delays
- **Receiver Mode**: Receives packets, validates payload, and calculates PER statistics

### Protocol Details

The PER test uses an 8-byte structured payload:
- **Header**: "PER" (3 bytes)
- **Separator**: 0x00 (1 byte)
- **Counter**: 32-bit exchange counter (4 bytes)

## Compilation

### USP Zephyr

**Build receiver:**
```bash
west build --pristine --board xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp --shield semtech_loraplus_expansion_board --shield semtech_wio_lr2021 usp_zephyr/samples/usp/sdk/packet_error_rate_lora -- -DEXTRA_CFLAGS="-DROLE=RECEIVER"
```

**Build transmitter:**
```bash
west build --pristine --board xiao_nrf54l15/nrf54l15/cpuapp --shield semtech_loraplus_expansion_board --shield semtech_wio_lr2021 usp_zephyr/samples/usp/sdk/packet_error_rate_lora -- -DEXTRA_CFLAGS="-DROLE=TRANSMITTER"
```

```bash
west flash
```

### USP
**Build receiver:**
```bash
rm -Rf build/ ; cmake -L -S examples  -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DBOARD=NUCLEO_L476 -DRAC_RADIO=lr2021 -G Ninja; cmake --build build --target per_tx
```

**Build transmitter:**
```bash
rm -Rf build/ ; cmake -L -S examples  -B build -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=MinSizeRel -DBOARD=NUCLEO_L476 -DRAC_RADIO=lr2021 -G Ninja; cmake --build build --target per_rx
```

```bash
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l4x.cfg -c "adapter serial <SERIAL_NUMBER>" -c "program build/per_rx verify reset exit"
openocd -f interface/stlink.cfg -f target/stm32l4x.cfg -c "adapter serial <SERIAL_NUMBER>" -c "program build/per_tx verify reset exit"
```

## Usage

1. Compile and flash receiver firmware to the second device using `ROLE=RECEIVER`
2. Compile and flash transmitter firmware to the first device using `ROLE=TRANSMITTER`
3. Start the receiver first - it will wait for packets
4. Start the transmitter - it will begin sending numbered packets automatically
5. Monitor UART debug output on both devices to observe test progress
6. After 100 packets, statistics are displayed and a new series begins automatically
